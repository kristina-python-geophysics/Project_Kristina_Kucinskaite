# Project_Kristina_Kucinskaite
---PROJECT DESCRIPTION---

In this project I plan to start developing scripts that would simulate a 1D and 2D synthetic response of seismic wave propagation and atteniation in heterogenious media with velocity gradient. In other words - forward modelling. 

Input velocity models will be created based on one of the study cases that I'm currently working on for my PhD. 

Synthetic seismic data will be modelled by solving a 1D and 2D acoustic wave equation with finite differences method.
